# 📊 Data Mining & Movie Review Analysis Projects  
🛠️ Project 1: Clustering with K-Means  
📌 Overview  
This project implements K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm, to group data into meaningful clusters. It helps in discovering hidden patterns within the dataset.  

🔹 Features  
✅ Preprocessing and feature scaling of the dataset  
✅ Implementation of K-Means for clustering  
✅ Optimal K-value selection using the Elbow Method  
✅ Visualization of clusters using Matplotlib & Seaborn  

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  

# 🎬 Project 2: Movie Review Analysis with Random Forest  
📌 Overview  
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using a Random Forest classifier. The model evaluates the sentiment (positive/negative) and measures accuracy using the ROC AUC Curve.  

🔹 Features  
✅ Text preprocessing using TF-IDF Vectorization  
✅ Training a Random Forest model for sentiment classification  
✅ Model evaluation using ROC AUC Curve for performance measurement  
✅ Visualization of results and performance metrics  

🛠️ Tech Stack  
Programming Language: Python  
Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK
